## Design Decisions (Rationale)

| Decision | Rationale |
|---|---|
| Single HTML file | Simplest possible deploy — no CI, no build failures, just push to GitHub |
| Romanian as default lang | Majority of guests are Romanian-speaking; EN toggle for international guests |
| Gift section EN-only | Couple's choice — Romanian guests receive gift guidance via other channels |
| Book gift + money | Reflects couple's values; book stand at reception is the primary gift invitation |
| No booking/table tools on site | Keep it simple; complex logistics handled offline |
| Organised transport option | Venue is 20km from city; many guests won't have cars |
| Zeama lunch RSVP | Separate headcount needed for day-after recovery lunch at same venue |
| PWA without service worker | Manifest added for installability; offline caching not needed for a wedding invite |
| Hero object-position 22% | Optimised for the specific hero.jpg — faces are upper-centre |
